Hello, World!

I'm Kevin. I've been interested in programming for quite some time now and recently
signed up for a Java class and have really enjoyed it so far! I was told about the
awesomeness of GitHub by a friend (GitHub: aclissold) who is also the same person
that turned me on to programing in the first place!

I'm here now to upload my school work and show my progress as I go through my class and
a if anyone has any advice, comments, or critiques, they're most certainly welcomed!
